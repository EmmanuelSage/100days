# Welcome to 100days

## Introduction

This is the repo accompanying my decision to do a 100days coding challenge where I learn and create awesome stuff, using
Python, Javascript, C# and go.

Let's learn and create awesome stuff together.

### Content

- [Day 1](./day1/index.md)

Day 1/100: I learned how networking works in cloud computing, vpc and subnets in aws, ssh, Ipv4 (octet), and deploying a production app to aws.

I also learned about material design from https://material.io/design/introduction and https://twitter.com/EmmanuelOluyale/status/1179156828808208386


Day 2/100: created a text editor using Slate.js and http://socket.io, the editor syncs across browsers, much like google docs, and would be useful for the ***dollop*** project I would be working on in the days to come. https://t.co/7lcWk8sJJg?amp=1

Day 3/100: Read through Slate.js Documentation, implemented my custom formatting for the editor, implemented shortcut commands for the editor, still need to tidy up the UI for the editor.

Day 4/100: Implemented a Web playground with react, similar to http://codepen.io, it takes your html,css and js and renders the result as you write code. Thanks,
@Folabi_xo for suggesting I build this today.

Day 5/100: I Improved my knowledge of regular expressions and implemented a template engine (using regex) that I could use for my code generator Project. also researched commander npm for building the cli.

Day 6/100: I read the material UI component api documentation and implemented a simple search application in react, and read Airtable documentation to use as a database for quick prototypes.

- Started the next day gap

Day 7/100: Implemented the exercise application with material ui following this tutorial playlist.

Day 8/100:  Solved Algorithm questions on https://codewars.com , would combine with https://hackerrank.com in the coming days perhaps js for codewars and python on hackerrank.

Day 9/100:  found and read this document https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1702/1702.01715.pdf to compare engineering practices across companies.
Also learned about managing some of the limitations of microservices with event-driven microservices

Day 10/100: to understand stuff better, I implemented my custom JavaScript Promise this article helped https://levelup.gitconnected.com/understand-javascript-promises-by-building-a-promise-from-scratch-84c0fd855720, Also Started implementation of a Custom React Renderer this is really helpful https://t.co/uvVzpbi2yf?amp=1


Day 11/100: solving through 100algorithms alongside codewars and hackerrank, trying to find a pattern to problem solving, would write an article if I do find, here is PizzaPokerGuy's repo https://t.co/yddnIPoZNw?amp=1

Day 12/100: read through learn enough css to be dangerous, this gave me an Idea for the code editor I wrote earlier, I would post an update on that soon,it also inspired me to use a storybook to create a playground for material design.

Day 13/100: was introduced to http://exercism.io did the setup and solved some algorithms checkout at : https://exercism.io/my/tracks

Day 14/100: Started recursion on https://leetcode.com and discovered https://careercup.com for solving algorithms, also started filling in some hostConfig methods for the react-reconciler still don't know what most of them do though.

Day 15/100: added snapshot feature to the editor, This allows you to time travel to the past or future in the code pen to understand how it was done better.
Code example credit: https://codepen.io/Adir-SL/pen/BXQBLx

Day 16/100: implemented the update methods for the hostConfig to allow for state management in the custom react renderer I wrote, Now That I have a little understanding of writing custom renderers, I am itching to target a platform.

Day 17/100: Implemented a simple cli tool, that allows you to save any project setup as a template and use it anywhere, this can save one the hassle of repeating project setups, I am looking to extend it with commander js.

Day 18/100: Did a bit of ethical webscraping for a resource I needed, and went through OWAPS top 10 and their counter measures, I did, Injection (especially sql injection), Broken Authentication, and Sensitive data exposure.

Day 19/100: I continued OWAPS top 10 and their counter measures, I did, XML External Entities (XXE), Broken Access Control, Security misconfigurations and Cross Site Scripting (XSS).

Day 20/100: I completed OWAPS top 10 and their countermeasures,  A good article I found that summarizes it well is https://www.greycampus.com/blog/information-security/owasp-top-vulnerabilities-in-web-applications

Day 21/100: spent time understanding complexity theory and how it relates to linear, polynomial, and exponential time, studied Big O, and the P vs NP problem, also spent time understanding how to create user persona for UX.

Day 22/100: spent some time writing an algorithm to identify a Pin Bar in mql4, (shooting star, and hammer). currently works but would need to optimize it. I also learned about Aws Router53 and the record types.

Day 23/100: Worked with ER diagrams and speeding up sql queries with indexes in postgresql http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-indexes/postgresql-create-index/

Day 24/100: I implemented a simple compiler, with a lexical analyser, parser, and transpiler, to better understand how programming languages works. A useful article in js is https://blog.mgechev.com/2017/09/16/developing-simple-interpreter-transpiler-compiler-tutorial/

Day 25/100: went through the front end masters course motion design with CSS. learned about stateful animations and performance optimizations.

Day 31/100: My Phone got stolen, tracked it but couldn't get it back. I am extremely sad but I still worked on a cli tooling  project and explored codingame, you solve algorithms by playing games you should try it https://www.codingame.com/start

- day 33 was done a day later. used that saturday after my phone was stolen to visit friends

Day 32/100: Spent some time refactoring code on my implementation of promises in javascript and learned about pathfinding algorithms the article https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/path-finding-algorithms-f65a8902eb40 helps to summarize.

Day 33/100: I should have posted this yesterday but couldn't.

Day 37/100: I came to the realization that although I have been writing javascript for some time I have never read the Specification 😲. So I spent time going through the specification. You should try it. https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html

Day 38/100: continued Reading of the ECMAScript specification, learning a lot. I should write a summary sometime. Also Checkout the locations of the submarine cables that make up the internet across the world at
https://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/

Day 39/100: Learned how synchronous javascript itself is, but with things like background threads (node)/web browser API, event loop, call stack, job queue, task queue, we have asynchronous code. and how they interact (execution context).

Day 40/100: Still reading ECMAScript 10 specfications. You basically get the line by line algorithm that browsers should implement, this deepens your understanding of how your code works, i.e string constructor https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-text-processing

Day 41/100: good code = 1. Readability, 2. Scalability (space or time). Hence I practiced big (o) on code and of data structures, cheatsheet=https://bigocheatsheet.com  I also Implemented an Array data structure in javascript using an object.

Day 42/100: going in-depth into data structures, I implemented hash tables, linked lists (doubly and singly), stacks and queues, reversed a linked list and solved the question at leetcode :  https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/. Yous should try it.

Day 52/100: Solved algorithms and worked on the document describing the Engineers Journey, still need a good name for it though.

Day 53/100: Learning about design, balance, harmony, and color. Ever heard the phrase "Form should follow function". One of the arguments there was that form should not follow function but work together. This is intriguing to me.

Day 54/100: Worked on the Front-end section of the Engineering Document,  Worked with firebase, worked with implementing memoization in redux using selectors with the reselect library to improve performance, also did state normalization.

Day 55/100: Spent time learning the observer Pattern in Javascript, and continued work on the engineering document, I have completed the requirements for frontend, backend and fullstack(unicorn). Would need to structure it further.

Day 56/100: I worked on the Engineering document specifically on trimming the requirements to be stack agnostic.
I Still need to categorize the requirements but would put what I have on gh-pages tomorrow.

Day 57/100: Worked with Graphql (Apollo), Lazy loading, Suspense, memoization (React.memo/PureComponent), Error boundaries, useCallback, PWA, Gzipping. Also pushed Enginrn doc to gh-pages still needs a ton of work. https://emmanuelsage.github.io/engineering-guide/
