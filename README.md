# Welcome to 100days

## Introduction

This is the repo accompanying my decision to do a 100days coding challenge where I learn and create awesome stuff, using
Python, Javascript, C# and go.

Let's learn and create awesome stuff together.

### Content

- [Day 1](./day1/index.md)

Day 1/100: I learned how networking works in cloud computing, vpc and subnets in aws, ssh, Ipv4 (octet), and deploying a production app to aws.

I also learned about material design from https://material.io/design/introduction and https://twitter.com/EmmanuelOluyale/status/1179156828808208386


Day 2/100: created a text editor using Slate.js and http://socket.io, the editor syncs across browsers, much like google docs, and would be useful for the ***dollop*** project I would be working on in the days to come. https://t.co/7lcWk8sJJg?amp=1

Day 3/100: Read through Slate.js Documentation, implemented my custom formatting for the editor, implemented shortcut commands for the editor, still need to tidy up the UI for the editor.

Day 4/100: Implemented a Web playground with react, similar to http://codepen.io, it takes your html,css and js and renders the result as you write code. Thanks, 
@Folabi_xo for suggesting I build this today.

Day 5/100: I Improved my knowledge of regular expressions and implemented a template engine (using regex) that I could use for my code generator Project. also researched commander npm for building the cli.

Day 6/100: I read the material UI component api documentation and implemented a simple search application in react, and read Airtable documentation to use as a database for quick prototypes.

- Started the next day gap

Day 7/100: Implemented the exercise application with material ui following this tutorial playlist.

Day 8/100:  Solved Algorithm questions on https://codewars.com , would combine with https://hackerrank.com in the coming days perhaps js for codewars and python on hackerrank.

Day 9/100:  found and read this document https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1702/1702.01715.pdf to compare engineering practices across companies.
Also learned about managing some of the limitations of microservices with event-driven microservices

Day 10/100: to understand stuff better, I implemented my custom JavaScript Promise this article helped https://levelup.gitconnected.com/understand-javascript-promises-by-building-a-promise-from-scratch-84c0fd855720, Also Started implementation of a Custom React Renderer this is really helpful https://t.co/uvVzpbi2yf?amp=1


Day 11/100: solving through 100algorithms alongside codewars and hackerrank, trying to find a pattern to problem solving, would write an article if I do find, here is PizzaPokerGuy's repo https://t.co/yddnIPoZNw?amp=1

Day 12/100: read through learn enough css to be dangerous, this gave me an Idea for the code editor I wrote earlier, I would post an update on that soon,it also inspired me to use a storybook to create a playground for material design.

Day 13/100: was introduced to http://exercism.io did the setup and solved some algorithms checkout at : https://exercism.io/my/tracks

Day 14/100: Started recursion on https://leetcode.com and discovered https://careercup.com for solving algorithms, also started filling in some hostConfig methods for the react-reconciler still don't know what most of them do though.

Day 15/100: added snapshot feature to the editor, This allows you to time travel to the past or future in the code pen to understand how it was done better.
Code example credit: https://codepen.io/Adir-SL/pen/BXQBLx

Day 16/100: implemented the update methods for the hostConfig to allow for state management in the custom react renderer I wrote, Now That I have a little understanding of writing custom renderers, I am itching to target a platform.

Day 17/100: Implemented a simple cli tool, that allows you to save any project setup as a template and use it anywhere, this can save one the hassle of repeating project setups, I am looking to extend it with commander js.

Day 18/100: Did a bit of ethical webscraping for a resource I needed, and went through OWAPS top 10 and their counter measures, I did, Injection (especially sql injection), Broken Authentication, and Sensitive data exposure.

Day 19/100: I continued OWAPS top 10 and their counter measures, I did, XML External Entities (XXE), Broken Access Control, Security misconfigurations and Cross Site Scripting (XSS).

Day 20/100: I completed OWAPS top 10 and their countermeasures,  A good article I found that summarizes it well is https://www.greycampus.com/blog/information-security/owasp-top-vulnerabilities-in-web-applications

Day 21/100: spent time understanding complexity theory and how it relates to linear, polynomial, and exponential time, studied Big O, and the P vs NP problem, also spent time understanding how to create user persona for UX.

Day 22/100: spent some time writing an algorithm to identify a Pin Bar in mql4, (shooting star, and hammer). currently works but would need to optimize it. I also learned about Aws Router53 and the record types.

Day 23/100: Worked with ER diagrams and speeding up sql queries with indexes in postgresql http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-indexes/postgresql-create-index/

Day 24/100: I implemented a simple compiler, with a lexical analyser, parser, and transpiler, to better understand how programming languages works. A useful article in js is https://blog.mgechev.com/2017/09/16/developing-simple-interpreter-transpiler-compiler-tutorial/

Day 25/100: went through the front end masters course motion design with CSS. learned about stateful animations and performance optimizations.

Day 26/100: started work on writing a version control system like git, in the bid to understand how it works internally, this implementation helped alot in understanding it http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/docs/gitlet.html

Day 27/100: started the create with code course on unity https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code.
Also implemented a Picture swap Augmented Reality using Vuforia with unity for my Andriod device.

Day 28/100: learned about the execution plan of SQL queries (like seq scan and hash join) and how to optimize them, I ran queries in http://sqlfiddle.com and viewed the execution plan. Checkout the seq scan on 
https://www.depesz.com/2013/04/27/explaining-the-unexplainable-part-2/#seq-scan

Day 29/100: implemented an app that uses electron for the interface connected it to python for the logic, also worked on using react to build with electron. this is a good intro https://youtu.be/zq-XcnjLpXI

Day 30/100:  spent time going through https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming it goes through materials you could use to make up for not having a cs degree. I seriously recommend it, thanks 
@Folabi_xo

Day 31/100: My Phone got stolen, tracked it but couldn't get it back. I am extremely sad but I still worked on a cli tooling  project and explored codingame, you solve algorithms by playing games you should try it https://www.codingame.com/start

- day 33 was done a day later. used that saturday after my phone was stolen to visit friends 

Day 32/100: Spent some time refactoring code on my implementation of promises in javascript and learned about pathfinding algorithms the article https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/path-finding-algorithms-f65a8902eb40 helps to summarize.

Day 33/100: I should have posted this yesterday but couldn't.
Spent sometime revisiting promises to explain to a friend, a good material I used was https://javascript.info/callbacks, I think the site is one of the best places to learn JavaScript.

Day 34/100: I spent time revisiting C# concepts for my unity certification soon and the react to C# console pet project I had in mind. it would enable you to write C# console applications using react.\

Day 35/100: I spent time reflecting on acid properties, a good summary can be found here https://geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/ it's worth looking into.
I Also worked with psql and psycopg2 and found out that before agile was Xp, Crystal, DSDM, and FDD.

Day 36/100: I spent time learning about parallax scrolling after seeing this website http://antonandirene.com. This site links to tutorials https://3.7designs.co/blog/2012/01/parallax-scrolling-effect-12-tutorials-an/, and this is a slight intro tutorial with examples

Day 37/100: I came to the realization that although I have been writing javascript for some time I have never read the Specification ðŸ˜². So I spent time going through the specification. You should try it. https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html

Day 38/100: continued Reading of the ECMAScript specification, learning a lot. I should write a summary sometime. Also Checkout the locations of the submarine cables that make up the internet across the world at
https://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/

Day 39/100: Learned how synchronous javascript itself is, but with things like background threads (node)/web browser API, event loop, call stack, job queue, task queue, we have asynchronous code. and how they interact (execution context).

Day 40/100: Still reading ECMAScript 10 specfications. You basically get the line by line algorithm that browsers should implement, this deepens your understanding of how your code works, i.e string constructor https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-text-processing

Day 41/100: good code = 1. Readability, 2. Scalability (space or time). Hence I practiced big (o) on code and of data structures, cheatsheet=https://bigocheatsheet.com  I also Implemented an Array data structure in javascript using an object.

Day 42/100: going in-depth into data structures, I implemented hash tables, linked lists (doubly and singly), stacks and queues, reversed a linked list and solved the question at leetcode :  https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/. Yous should try it.

Day 43/100: implemented and learned about binary trees, also did the min heap and max heap,  visualgo is good for visualizing and playing around with data structures https://visualgo.net/en/heap?slide=1

Day 44/100: worked with class indexes and generics in c#, Also studying graphs (weighed, cyclic, directed), learned about the Eulerian Path a good resource for graph algorithms is https://udacity.com/course/intro-to-algorithms--cs215 The course is just awesome.

Day 45/100: added a notes section to the code playground I was writing to sync up with the snapshot feature and made the sections collapsible.

Day 46/100: Attended #DevFest was cool, learned about Post-training quantization to reduce the model size you could check out https://tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization and also learned about https://amp.dev which is an open-source web framework.

Day 47/100: I went over System Architecture Design, and as usual this is a good place to start: https://medium.com/backendarmy/introduction-to-system-architecture-design-fcd4f327b6c9

Day 48/100: I Played around with https://docs.clarifai.com recognition api. worked on a service that needed to detect objects in a video and picture.

Day 49/100: I Re-discovered https://adventofcode.com  I went through some puzzles for previous years, They run it yearly from december 1st to 24th. I am patiently waiting for this year, join me if you can ðŸ˜€
